# Server

An application is being built for The Docs. If you wish to use the source code use the following instructions:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/DylanBulmer/TheDocs-Server.git`
2. Run `npm install` to grab the needed node modules
3. Run `npm start`

The `config.json` will need to be edited before starting to allow the server to connect to the database.
The website to edit the configuration is still being developed and cannot be used to edit the configuration of the server.
