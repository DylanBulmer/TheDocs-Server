## The Docs
 
Here is the start to building The Docs 2.0. After over a year's worth of work on The Docs, I had noticed a lot of flaws in the original designs. From UX to the database design, there were tons of issues due to improper planning. Once I noticed these issues, I stopped building the application, stepped back and started to think. After many months of recognizing the mistakes made, tons of researching and planning happened and now I am glad to announce The Docs 2.0 is starting to be developed.
 
## Servers
 
This repository contains two servers. One is the API server and the other is the web-interface for admins to read documentation of the project, view the support forums and manage their organization's account.
 
I have noticed that it is VERY beneficial to me to work on building up the interfaces and designing the UX before diving too deep into creating a database and developing API calls. As I design and develop the interfaces, I am able to think about what I want to store in the database and what I want from the API calls. As I develop this system this is what you will find.
